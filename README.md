# Code Automation Test

This is a Next.js project with comprehensive GitHub Copilot code review automation.

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Code Review Setup

This repository is configured with professional-grade GitHub Copilot code review automation using the latest industry best practices.

### 📁 Configuration Files

- **`.github/copilot.yaml`** - Main Copilot configuration with review settings, file patterns, and integration options
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - Comprehensive code review guidelines and prompts for Copilot

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### 1. Enable GitHub Copilot Code Review (Repository Settings)

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Code & automation** → **Copilot** → **Code review**
3. Enable **"Request pull request review from Copilot"**
4. Configure auto-assignment settings

#### 2. Branch Protection Rules (Automatic Review)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Rules** → **Rulesets**
2. Click **"New ruleset"** → **"New branch ruleset"**
3. Configure the following:
   ```yaml
   Ruleset name: "Copilot Auto Review"
   Enforcement Status: Active
   Target branches: Include default branch (main/master)
   Branch rules: 
     ☑️ Require a pull request before merging
     ☑️ Request pull request review from Copilot
   ```

#### 3. Repository Custom Instructions (Optional)

For additional customization, you can set repository-level custom instructions:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Code & automation** → **Copilot**
2. Add custom instructions specific to your project needs

### 🚀 How It Works

When you create a pull request:

1. **Automatic Assignment**: Copilot is automatically assigned as a reviewer
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Reviews code changes based on the comprehensive guidelines in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. **Structured Feedback**: Provides categorized feedback (Critical, Major, Minor, Suggestions)
4. **Technology-Specific Reviews**: Tailored feedback for TypeScript, React, CSS, etc.
5. **Security & Performance Focus**: Prioritizes security vulnerabilities and performance issues

### 📋 Review Coverage

Copilot reviews the following file types:
- TypeScript/JavaScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`)
- Stylesheets (`.css`, `.scss`, `.less`)
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml`)
- Documentation (`.md`)

**Excluded from review:**
- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`)
- Minified files (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`)
- Type declaration files (`*.d.ts`)

### 🎯 Review Focus Areas

- **🔒 Security**: OWASP Top 10, input validation, authentication
- **⚡ Performance**: Re-renders, memory leaks, algorithm efficiency
- **🧹 Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, best practices
- **♿ Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, semantic HTML
- **🔧 TypeScript**: Type safety, proper type definitions

### 💡 Example Review Comments

#### Critical Security Issue
```markdown
🔴 Security: SQL Injection Vulnerability
Problem: Direct string concatenation in SQL query
Impact: Potential data breach through SQL injection
Solution: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods
```

#### Performance Suggestion
```markdown
🟡 Performance: Unnecessary Re-renders
Current: Component re-renders on every parent update
Suggestion: Wrap component with React.memo and optimize dependencies
Benefit: Reduces unnecessary computations and improves UI responsiveness
```

#### Best Practice Recommendation
```markdown
💡 Code Quality: Extract Reusable Logic
Observation: Similar validation logic repeated across components
Recommendation: Create a custom hook or utility function
Benefit: Reduces code duplication and improves maintainability
```

### 🔄 Triggering Reviews

Copilot automatically reviews when:
- New pull request is opened
- Existing PR is updated (synchronize)
- Draft PR is marked as ready for review

### ⚙️ Customization

To customize the review behavior:

1. **Modify `.github/copilot.yaml`** for file patterns, exclusions, and settings
2. **Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** for review guidelines and prompts
3. **Adjust branch protection rules** for different target branches

### 📊 Best Practices

- **Keep PRs focused**: Smaller PRs get better review quality
- **Provide context**: Clear PR descriptions help Copilot understand intent
- **Address feedback promptly**: Copilot learns from your responses
- **Use positive feedback**: Acknowledge good suggestions to improve AI learning

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
